# Project 2 - Asteroids

### Developer Info

-   Name: Tyler Garcia

### Description

This project was using our skills of collision detection, player input, vector movement, and UI to create a version of the Asteroids game

For this project, we had to utilize these methods via multiple classes and components working together. We also had to use our recent knowledge of collision detection techniques, player input, movement of objects using vectors and Quaternions, as well as UI creation.

### User Responsibilities

Use space to shoot bullets at the asteroids and use WASD to move in each direction respectively (W for forward, S for backward, A for left, and D for right). Big asteroids are 20 points while smaller asteroid fragments are 50 points. Once dead (losing all lives), the user will need to press 'c' on their keyboard in order to play again once they lose all their lives.

### Known Issues

There are no known errors.
